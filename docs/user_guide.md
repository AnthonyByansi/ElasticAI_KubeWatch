## 📄 Configuration

Before starting the auto-scaling process, make sure to configure the following settings:

1. **Azure Functions Configuration**:
   - Set up the Azure Functions environment variables, including Azure Monitor connection settings and scaling rules.

2. **Kubernetes Configuration**:
   - Customize the Kubernetes Deployment manifest to suit your application's requirements.
   - Configure the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) with the desired metrics and thresholds.

3. **Machine Learning Model Integration (Optional)**:
   - If using the machine learning model for demand forecasting, set up the model and connect it to the Azure Functions environment.

## 📈 Monitoring Performance Metrics

ElasticAI KubeWatch relies on real-time performance metrics to make scaling decisions. Monitor the following metrics in Azure Monitor or other monitoring tools:

- Request Rate
- CPU Usage
- Memory Consumption
- Response Time
- Other application-specific metrics

## ⚖️ Scaling Rules

Configure the scaling rules in `config/scaling_rules.yaml`. Define the thresholds and conditions that trigger auto-scaling, such as:

- Scale up if CPU Usage > 70% for 5 minutes.
- Scale down if Request Rate < 10 requests/minute for 10 minutes.
- Customize rules based on your application's characteristics and requirements.

## 📊 Machine Learning Integration (Optional)

If you opt for machine learning-based demand forecasting, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Data**: Gather historical performance data to train the machine learning model.

2. **Train the Model**: Use the `ml_model.py` script to train the model with the historical data.

3. **Integrate with Azure Functions**: Connect the trained model to the Azure Functions environment for real-time predictions.

## 🚧 Troubleshooting

Encountering issues? Here are some common troubleshooting steps:

- Check logs and error messages from Azure Functions and Kubernetes.
- Verify that Azure Monitor is collecting the required performance metrics.

## 💡 Best Practices

Ensure a smooth auto-scaling experience by following these best practices:

- Regularly monitor application performance metrics to fine-tune scaling rules.
- Set appropriate thresholds to avoid unnecessary scaling actions.
- Keep the machine learning model updated with recent data for accurate demand forecasting.
