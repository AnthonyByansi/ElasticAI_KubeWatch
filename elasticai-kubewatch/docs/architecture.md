# 🏢 Architecture

The **ElasticAI KubeWatch** solution is built to provide intelligent auto-scaling for applications deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) while leveraging AI-powered insights. 🚀

## 📚 Overview

ElasticAI KubeWatch architecture combines Azure Functions, Kubernetes, and machine learning components to achieve dynamic resource scaling based on real-time performance metrics. 📈

## 🧱 Key Components

The architecture consists of the following components:

1. **Azure Functions**: Serve as the control plane for auto-scaling, analyzing real-time metrics to make scaling decisions. 🔍

2. **Kubernetes**: Provides the foundation for running the application and enables the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for dynamic scaling. 🛡️

3. **Machine Learning Model (Optional)**: Forecasting model uses historical data to predict future demand and optimize resource allocation. 📊

## 🔄 Auto-Scaling Workflow

1. Azure Functions collect performance metrics from Azure Monitor and analyze trends. ⏲️

2. Based on configured rules and machine learning insights (if used), the Functions determine whether to scale up or down. ⚖️

3. When scaling is required, Azure Functions interact with Kubernetes to adjust the number of replicas in the Deployment. ⚙️

4. Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) continuously monitors the application's resource usage and triggers scaling events. 🚀

## 🌐 External Integrations

The ElasticAI KubeWatch solution can seamlessly integrate with various external tools and services, such as:

- **Azure Monitor**: Collects and stores real-time performance metrics, ensuring effective monitoring. 📊

- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: Hosts the application and provides auto-scaling capabilities through the HPA. 🛡️

## 🏋️‍♀️ Scalability & Performance

The architecture's modularity and use of AI-driven scaling empower applications to handle varying workloads efficiently. 💪

## 🔒 Security Considerations

ElasticAI KubeWatch implements secure practices to protect data and maintain the integrity of the auto-scaling process. 🔐
